1. Can I explain what my code does?
-  The main goal of this project was to create an interactive adventure game where users make decisions at different points in the story. I choose a story and made the game on the basis of that story. The story is picked from the series "All of us are dead". The core of the project revolves around managing different states (like starting the game, making choices, and displaying the consequences of those choices). I used JavaScript to dynamically update the content based on user input, adding buttons for each choice and updating the question and options as the user progresses through the story.The key part of the code is the renderQuestion() function, which determines what question and choices should be shown based on the current state. Another important piece is addAnswerButton(), which creates the buttons for each choice and appends them to the webpage. All these components work together to deliver a seamless experience where the user can make choices and explore different story paths.

2. What was my coding process?
- My coding process started with planning the different story paths and decision points, which I laid out in a markdown file to get a clear picture of how the game would flow. Once I had a good grasp of the story structure, I moved on to the HTML structure, making sure I had the necessary placeholders for dynamic content.Then, I focused on the JavaScript logic, starting with basic state management and progressing to more complex tasks like dynamically updating the UI based on user choices. I tested the game as I built each new feature, which helped me catch issues early. For example, I worked on ensuring keyboard navigation and accessibility by adding ARIA roles and testing the game's responsiveness.

3. What challenges did I have?
- One of the main challenges I faced was figuring out how to keep the code clean while managing different story paths. It was easy to get overwhelmed when handling multiple states and making sure the buttons appeared in the correct sequence. I solved this by breaking down the process into small steps, testing each one, and using clear naming conventions for the different states. Another challenge was ensuring accessibility. I had to research how to implement ARIA roles and make sure that keyboard navigation worked well.

4. What would I do differently now?
- Well, I think that I already did good as i did planning, research before starting the project. One thing, I will do better is about the accessibility as I add some accessibility features but after testing them in W3C Validator, it shows that some of them are unnecessary, so if I will get a chance to start the project from beginning, I will do more research on accessibility features.
